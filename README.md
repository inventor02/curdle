# curdle

Curdle is a clone of the popular Internet-based word guessing game _Wordle_ written in C, using SDL2 for graphics.

I made it because I wanted something to do in my week off after exams (I am an undergraduate in Computer Science).

You should really play the [real thing](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) because it's really fun.
