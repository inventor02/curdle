# curdle

**Curdle** is a daily word guessing game similar in nature to a popular game which is web-based. Curdle is written in C, using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) (and related libraries) for graphics. We aim to make it support Linux (which it is developed on), Windows, and macOS.

The project team is made up of:
- [George Peppard](https://github.com/inventor02)
- [Toby Godfrey](https://github.com/tgodfrey0)
- [Adam Caine](https://github.com/a-caine)

We're all Computer Science undergraduates at the [University of Southampton](https://ecs.soton.ac.uk) and we started this project because we:
- had a week between the end of our exams and the start of teaching for the next semester (you may notice this week has now passed, and we are still working on this...)
- wanted something to do
- wanted practice with the C programming language (and by extent it's graphics libraries)
